Git Hook 
Git hooks are executed before and after events like commits and pushes. We used the pre-commit hook. It is able to automatically report security weaknesses when a Python file is changed and committed. Git hooks allow for automating tasks for whole projects making it a very useful tool.

Forensics 
The file knn.py had 5 methods modified which were euc_dist, predict, calculate_k, calculate_metrics, and perform_inference. Our logger is able to capture the information from each method and then output it.
